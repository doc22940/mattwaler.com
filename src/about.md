  Here is where I tell you all about myself, my interests, and try not to send you running off in the other direction.

## Hello, My name is Matt!

I'm an Ohio University graduate from Broadview Heights, Ohio. I love development, lifting, and the occasional blockbuster. I like to think I'm decently funny, but my friends can assure you that I am not.

### Hitting the Gym

I try to hit the gym a few times a week to build those vanity muscles. My goal is to look like Brad Pitt in Fight Club.

### Listening to Audiobooks

Reading is difficult for me, but I love audiobooks. My favorite listen so far has been Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke.

### Listening to Podcasts

When doing mundane tasks, I usually toss in my headphones and try to learn from others. I love Syntax and Fullstack Radio.

### Playing Tennis

I played a lot of Tennis in High School, and have since rekindled the flame. Currently working on getting my topspin back to what it used to be.

### Watching Movies

I absolutely love movies. I am a sucker for anything by Edgar Wright. My favorite film to date is Jojo Rabbit by Taika Waititi.

### Web Development

You will often catch me researching, practicing, and trying out the latest and greatest to stay at the top of my game.
